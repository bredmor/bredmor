### Hello! 🖥️

I'm Morgan, a software engineer and hardware hacker in 🍑Atlanta, USA.

I build mostly API-driven web platforms for my clients, and work on IoT and smart devices in my spare time. I mostly build projects with Raspberry Pis, Arduino and the ESP32 platform, though I'm no stranger to bare metal ARM development either!

I'm also an avid computer gamer, and love working on accessibility tools to make sure everyone is able to enjoy my favorite games.

## Collaboration

If you have a cool project you think I could contribute to, feel free to reach out to me on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/bredmor) - especially if it's related to accessibility.

## My Work

I generally work with **PHP**, **JavaScript**, **Rust** or **Python**.

I have several public repositories on github that are worth checking out:

### 💬 [Simple DiscordJS Bot](https://github.com/bredmor/simple-discord-js-bot)

### 📊 [Comment Analyzer](https://github.com/bredmor/comment-analyzer)
