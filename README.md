### Hello! üñ•Ô∏è

I'm Morgan, a software engineer and hardware hacker in üçëAtlanta, USA.

I build mostly API-driven web platforms for my clients, and work on IoT and smart devices in my spare time. I generally build projects with Raspberry Pis and the ESP32 platform, or the occasional recycled Android.

I'm also an avid computer gamer, and love working on accessibility tools to make sure everyone is able to enjoy my favorite games.
